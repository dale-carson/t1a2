                <h1>Work History</h1>
                <p>My work history has been pretty varied through out my life. I spent the first 5 years in retail starting as a shop assistant who also did the early morning paper runs,before eventually progressing into becoming a shift manager for my local woolworths.<br>I then moved into the manufacturing industry where i have spent the rest of my work life in. I have worked for companies like coke cola, chemical manufacturing, and a large mining company. My roles in the industry have been mainly machine operation and forklift operations. </p>

                <h1>Work Future</h1>
                <p>In the future i plan to venture into the world of web design. I love the way it makes you have to problem solve, as i do get a enjoyment out of finding a solution to different varieties of problems. I feel like this is a industry that i want to spend the rest of my work life in, as i want a career where i can constantly learn in, as compared to my previous work history, which once you knew the role there was no more grow or knowledge to obtain.</p>
