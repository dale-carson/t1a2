# About Website
The purpose of this website is to showcase the things i have learnt so far in the course. I started by making it mobile friendly first and then added in media breakpoints.
The website describes what my interest are and also what my work history and work future are about.
I have added in features on a mobile device that when u scroll down you can find links to other pages.
I have also added links in the footer on all pages that access my social media.
I have also added a floating nav menu that displays differently between ipad and desktop but isn't shown on mobile devices.
Nav bar and button have hover effects and the button links to my resume.
I have added a form for people to get in contact with me that has hover effects.
I aslo added in a logo for my name.
I made images move around as the screen size changes.
I also made an extra media break point as it looked bad on my wide screen monitor.

# Target Audience
My target audience is future employers and for my peers.

# Tech stack
